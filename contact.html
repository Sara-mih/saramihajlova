        <h1 class="about">ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is <span class="s"> Sara</span>, and I'm currently a student at the Faculty of Information<br> and Communication Sciences (FINKI) in Skopje, North Macedonia. I am pursuing a <br>degree in Information Technology (IT), specifically focusing on Programming and <br> Information Technology (PIT).</p>
        <p>During my time at FINKI, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects that <br> have honed my programming skills and allowed me to collaborate with like-minded <br>individuals. </p>
        <p>Originally from Stip, a vibrant city known for its rich cultural heritage and friendly <br> atmosphere, I completed my secondary education at a local gymnasium. Stip holds a <br> special place in my heart as my hometown, known for its vibrant culture, historical <br> significance, and warm community spirit. </p>
        <p>Looking forward, I am eager to deepen my knowledge in IT, collaborate with peers <br> on exciting projects, and contribute meaningfully to the field. I believe in <br> continuous learning and embracing challenges as opportunities for personal and <br>professional growth. </p>
        <p>Feel free to connect with me to discuss technology, education, or anything in between. <br> I look forward to meeting new people and exploring new ideas together!
        </p>
